# tiny-agent

A completely front-end driven AI agent project, requiring no server resources.

## For Claude Code

Before you start thinking about the project, read the documents in the `/docs` folder. These documents describe the project structure and coding guidelines. The documents were written the last time the project was run. Every time code is generated, you should check if the documentation needs to be updated.
